# 📈 Strat-Based Trading Bot (Project Overview)

This is a technical breakdown of a real-time trading signal bot I built using Python and the Rob Smith #TheStrat methodology.

The bot:
- Monitors 15-minute price action on popular tickers (SPY, QQQ, TSLA, etc.)
- Detects key #TheStrat setups (e.g., 2-1-2 reversals, 3-1-2 continuations)
- Sends automatic alerts to a private Discord channel
- Uses scheduled checks and manual Discord buttons to run on demand
- Built fully using `yfinance`, `pandas`, `discord.py`, and `pandas_ta`

> ⚠️ **Note**: The full codebase is private to protect proprietary logic. I'm happy to discuss the architecture or provide a demo upon request.

### 💡 Motivation

I built this during my free time while between jobs (laid off) as a way to stay sharp, learn deeper trading logic, and build something useful from scratch.

### 🧠 Key Features

- **#TheStrat Signal Detection**: Built-in recognition for multi-timeframe strat patterns
- **5m and 3m Scanning**: Uses `yfinance` to simulate near-realtime data
- **Option Strike Suggestions**: Automatically selects at-the-money contracts using `yfinance`
- **Discord Bot Interface**: Clean alerts with option flow and strategy notes
- **Manual & Auto Modes**: Run scans on a button click or every few minutes
